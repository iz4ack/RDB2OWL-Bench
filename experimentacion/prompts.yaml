    I'll give you a SQL Schema, extract the full ontology from it in turtle syntax. 
    Include advance and complex classes, properties and restrictions necessary. 
    Make sure there are no turtle syntax errors. Use standard prefixes (rdf, rdfs, owl, xsd, :).
    Return only the Turtle content, with no additional explanations.

    SQL Schema:
    ```sql
    {{sql_schema}}
