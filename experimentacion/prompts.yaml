    I'll give you a SQL Schema, extract the full ontology from it in turtle syntax. 
    Include advance and complex classes, property and restrictions necessary. 
    Make sure the syntax is correct. Use standard prefixes (rdf, rdfs, owl, xsd, :).
    Return only the Turtle content, with no additional explanations.

    SQL Schema:
