    Please convert the following SQL schema into an OWL ontology using Turtle syntax.
    Define classes for each table, object and data properties according to the columns,
    include appropriate domains and ranges, and use standard prefixes (rdf, rdfs, owl, xsd).
    Return only the Turtle content, with no additional explanations.

    SQL Schema:
    ```sql
    {{sql_schema}}
    ```
